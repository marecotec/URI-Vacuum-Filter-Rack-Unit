# URI Vacuum Filter Rack Unit

This is a repository of various parts to construct the rather elaborate vacuum filter rack unit that we use onboard ships. We have a manifold system, with six outlets, and two sizes of cup, this is designed for the smaller cup but I will definitely make the larger one as well.
